# Studio


This is going to be the main repo for a hub of sorts for use with Civilhosting.net's website hosting environment test.


Includes stuff for:

Civilhosting.net
Ageofcivilizations.net
crazyscorner.xyz
and other personal projects. 


## Age Of Civilization (AOC)

Age of Civilization is a Minecraft servers website that I've been developing. 

Founded by Silent Assassin#0372, it is now maintained by Kitten#0322. I do the web development.

# Civilhosting.net

Founded by SilentAssassin and I, it is a server hosting platform that sell game servers ran through the "Pterodactyl" Panel. Check it out at https://civilhosting.net

### RRP 

Just a thing I had to do for school, it got me back into web development and without it, this wouldn't exist.

# Crazyscorner.xyz

Soon-to-be website as a portfolio of sorts for me and others to see.
